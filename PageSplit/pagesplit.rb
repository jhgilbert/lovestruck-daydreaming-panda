# run a loop
# each time the user inputs something, return how long it's been since the last time, after converting it to a m:s format (is this what we use time.diff for?)
# save the times into an array
# offer the average time at the end, along with the array
# break the loop when the user types "exit"

# Could a productivity suite be built in Rails?
# Each user has many time objects? They can be listed from least recent to most recent. They can be called splits.
